When I had the chance to go to Antarctica on an expedition cruise with Hurtigruten, I made it one of my goals to do my first ever polar plunge in the continent — and I did!

…However, it helps to note that this almost did NOT happen.

This is a “right of passage” for all of us who have adventurous souls as well as one of the best things to do in Antarctica; but of course, we all know that it isn’t exactly a wise decision to swim in the world’s coldest waters in just a bikini, right?

So yes, for total disclosure, I did spend some time debating with myself before the whole ordeal happened, and I segregate them into the following stages…

A few days after we’ve landed in the Antarctic Peninsula itself, the Hurtigruten crew announced our upcoming arrival to Deception Island: a unique place in the continent due to the fact that it is the caldera (volcanic ‘crater’) of an active volcano. To set everyone abuzz even further, they said that this will be the location wherein we would be allowed to do a polar plunge.

“This is it, I’m going to do a polar plunge!” I thought to myself excitedly.

After all, it’s not everyday that someone can have the unique opportunity of swimming in Antarctica waters — and even inside a volcano at that!

“Meh, I’m not going to do it.”

Jonas quipped from across the room while I was preparing my clothes for the shore landing in Deception Island.

“Wait, what? You won’t do the polar plunge?”
Jonas shrugged, “It’s not my thing, and I have to work.”

Well, there goes my ‘plunging’ support buddy! Aww…  Then again, nope, I was not to be swayed. Of course I was a bit disappointed, but I didn’t let it bother me too much.

Later at lunch, I passed by one of the service staff and he gave me a little nudge, “So, are you going to do the polar plunge today?”

“Yes,” I replied, “How about you? Have you done it before?”

He chuckled, “Yes, and I will NEVER do it again!”

Something in me faltered, but I shrugged it off. I went back to my cabin and in order to hype myself up for the experience, I typed the phrase “polar plunge” on my web browser. I simply wanted to browse through some cool photos — but one thing led to another… and I rather stumbled into article headlines that read:

Polar Plunges: Are They Even Good for You?
Is the Polar Plunge Safe?
Swimmer Rescued During Polar Plunge
How to Survive a Polar Plunge
Wait.
I can die from this? What do they mean it’s not safe? Someone had to be rescued before? And what — I have to “survive” it?

It then dawned on me that my initial “euphoria” on the idea of doing my first ever polar plunge had clouded my practical judgment that: OF. COURSE. Swimming in cold waters has risks that are not limited to shock, heart attack or hypothermia (maybe even drowning because I’m not a good swimmer myself lol). It didn’t even help that I started to recall how cold I felt when I first took a dip in European waters — and mind you, that was in the summer!

So okaaaay. Maybe this wasn’t a good idea after all…

Sure, I might die because of “cold shock” if I’m not healthy enough or if I happen to have a heart problem — but that’s just highly unlikely. The expedition team even told me that they never had someone who died from doing a polar plunge; besides, the whole plunge will only be for a few minutes (even seconds if anyone couldn’t bear it) and there will also be a doctor on shore.

Naturally, the above factors were all sensible reasons for lessening my building doubts and fears; but do you know what took it all away completely…? When I thought of ‘regrets’.

If you’re a regular reader of my blog and if you’ve followed my whole journey up to now, you would know how I dislike having regrets in my life. I didn’t want to have a lot of “what ifs” in the future — and certainly, I didn’t want this polar plunge to be one of those.

So that afternoon, I boarded the zodiac boat that was sailing to Deception Island’s Pendulum Cove. As I sat there, I can already see the cluster of ship guests on shore, both old and young, who were either stripping off their clothes or running straight into the freezing waters. I couldn’t help but giggle… “Yup, I am one of those crazy lunatics.”

After I set foot on the cove, Hurtigruten’s expedition team leader gave us a tip that we could walk (or even run) around the island before taking the dip so that our bodies can get to warm up a bit more before the plunge itself. However, I was in a daze — I went straight to the part of the shore where all the swimmers were.

I just wanted to get it over with before I could change my mind.

Once there, I did a quick chat with one of the swimmers who gave me an encouraging mini speech and then, without missing a beat, I set up my camera and started putting off one layer of clothing at a time. Now I assure you that I shuddered terribly when the harsh Antarctic winds first hit contact with my bare skin — plus, I felt even more chills when my bare feet touched the cold black sand. It didn’t even help that the water boots they made me wear was sogging wet!

I ran over to one of the expedition staff and muttered, “I’m ready.”

She put a check mark beside my name and afterwards, I swiftly turned and ran towards the water.

You see, running is essential in order for this particular polar plunge to be successful. Some other ships do it ‘pirate style’ where you get to jump off a plank; but for ships like Hurtigruten, it is up to you to set your pace — and nope, there’s no room for slow wading and adjusting here: you MUST run, or else, you might back out given that the water is so awfully cold.

So as my body gradually went through the water, all the obscene words that I’ve learned in this life spilled out from my lips.

And when the water hit my waist — there was a pause. I didn’t think that a sudden ‘slow mo’ could happen to me in real life, but it did. And for some reason the word “PLUNGE” popped in my head. Before I knew it, my body automatically did a little dive and then I was wholly under the water.

…Aaah, I can still recall how cold  and painful it was as if millions of tiny needles were piercing through my skin! But before I could process everything further, again: there was another pause and I think this is the part when my body was already done with the cold shock response. I proceeded to push myself out of the water and then walked back to shore. One of the expedition staff wrapped a towel around me while saying, “Good job!” and as I was drying myself off, I felt incredibly weird.

For some reason, my body didn’t feel like it was cold anymore. Rather, I felt so refreshed and energized.

At some point, I even took off my towel and then took some photos of myself on the beach with just my bikini on. But of course… I didn’t take too long because I know that my body must actually be very cold despite the numb yet invigorating feeling that I was having!

Soon after, I was back on the ship and enjoying a hot jacuzzi (as if to remind my body how it felt to be warm again).
